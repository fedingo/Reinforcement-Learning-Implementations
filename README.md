# Reinforcement-Learning-Implementations

This is the project that I developed for the Intelligent Systems for Pattern Recognition that I followed this year. The main goal was to develope and experiment with some Reinforcement Learning techniques. This project has been developed using Python, Keras and TensorFlow.

## Project Details

The experiments has been run using the [Openai Gym Library](https://gym.openai.com/). The games that I tried where:

- CartPole
- AcroBot
- Mountain Car

Only on the first 2 I was able to achieve good results. The agents shown good performances in general, been able to learn to play the game and achieving good results in general. Some experiments results to compare the agents are shown in the figure:

For more details you can find my project presentation [HERE](Project%20RL%20Implementations.pdf)

## Usage

The scripts requires that you install TensorFlow, Keras and the OpenAi Gym. Then the script will open a graph that will update after each episode. This will show the progress of the last 10 and 100 games average score of the agents.
